## Introduction

The Autonomous Driving High-Fiedelity Simulation project provides a realistic simulation environment where users can test and develop autonomous driving algorithms. The simulator includes various scenarios, vehicles, and sensors to emulate real-world conditions as closely as possible.

## Features

- Realistic physics engine
- Multiple vehicle models
- Sensor simulation (e.g., LiDAR, camera, radar)
- Traffic scenarios
- Weather conditions
- Multiple maps

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Unreal Engine 5.4](https://www.unrealengine.com/)
- [City Sample for UE 5.4](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-sample)

### Steps

1. Navigate to the City Sample directory:
   ```sh
   cd ~/CitySample/Content
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CHAROla1/AutonomousDrivingHighFidelitySimulation.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Autonomous-Driving-High-Fidelity-Simulation
4. Unzip the `Plugins` file, paste and cover its contents to your city sample's plugins folder.
5. Open the City Sample project and build it.
6. Import `Configs/ZoneGraphConfig.ini` to your project setting (Project Settings -> Engine -> Zone Graph -> Import).
